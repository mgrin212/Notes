# Statements, Proofs, and Contradiction

## Propositions 

What is a proposition?
    Definition: A proposition is a statement that is either **true** or **false**

    - Proposition 1: 2 + 3 = 5
    - Proposition 2: 1 + 1 = 3
    - Proposition 3: The sum of any two odd numbers is even
    - Proposition 4: The product of any two odd numbers is even

How do we tell if a proposition is true?

We can give an example: 

        - Proposition 5: There is a two-digit perfect square whose final digit is 4.
            - True. $8^2 = 64$
        - Proposition 6: There is a two-digit perfect square whose final digit is 8.
            - False. We can enumerate and see there is no possible answer
        - Proposition 7: There is a perfect square whose final digit is 4.
            - True. we showed it earlier
        - Proposition 8: There is a perfect square whose final digit is 8
            - False.


Proposition 9: For every nonnegative integer, n. the value of $n^2 + n + 41$ is prime

Proof by counter example: 
Define $p(n) ::= n^2 + n + 41$

$p(0) = 41$

$\vdots$

$p(10) = 151$

```math
\begin{align}
x &= 2 \tag{hi} \\
y &= x + 5 + x
\end{align}
```


## Notation
- $\mathbb{Z}$ is the **integers**
- $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is **positive integers**
- $\mathbb{N}$ is the **non-negative integers**
- $\forall$ means **for all**
- $\exists$ means **there exists**
